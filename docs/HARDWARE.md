# Hardware configuration

`hardware-configuration.nix` is auto-generated by `nixos-generate-config` at installation
time. It records detected disks, kernel modules, and other low-level settings.

Regeneration

- To regenerate after hardware changes: run `sudo nixos-generate-config` (typically writes to `/etc/nixos/`).
- If you prefer to track hardware in this repo, follow these steps:

  1. Run `sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt` (adjust root as needed).
  2. Inspect the output and replace device-specific UUIDs if you intend to reuse on multiple machines.

Commit policy

- The file may be committed as a snapshot. If you commit it, document why in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
