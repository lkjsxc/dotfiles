# Architecture — Design Notes

This folder contains notes describing why things are organized the way they are.

Files:
- `modules.md` — Rationale for module choices and future refactors.

Design principles:
- Keep configuration declarative and reproducible.
- Keep docs small, focused, and autogenerated where practical.
